/* Purpose: The report consolidates key product metrics and behaviours

Highlights:
	1) Gathers essential fields such as product_name, category, subcategory and cost.
    2) Segments products by revenue to identify High-performers, Mid_range, or Low-Performers.
    3) Aggregates product-level metrics
		- total orders
        - total sales
        - total quantity sold
        - total customers (unique)
        - lifespan (in months)
	4) Calculates valuable KPIs
		- recency (months since last sale)
        - average order revenue (AOR)
        - average monthly revenue
